This script will perform the following steps on the UCI HAR Dataset.

1. Merge the test and train data sets to create one data set
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Apply descriptive column names to name the activities in the data set
4. Label the data set with descriptive activity names
5. Creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each subject / activity


### Additional Information
Additional information about the variables, data and transformations can be found in the CodeBook.MD file.
